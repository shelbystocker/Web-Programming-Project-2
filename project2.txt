Project #2 - Due Monday-February 26, 23:59:59pm

Use Canvas and submit your JavaScript file as "Project #2".  
Please name your file Lname.html, or Lname1Lname2.html if you 
work in a group of two, and then zip it as the same name .zip.
---------------------------------------------------------

Note: You shall follow Dr. Finkel's checklist for good programming:
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/checklist.html

---------------------------------------------------------
While utilizing your universal translator web application, 
Xelkalai has discovered something not found on his home planet 
of Xarnaco.  He has discovered anagrams:
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram).

He has commissioned you to write a simple anagram game in 
JavaScript.

Requirements:

    - You shall start with Xelkalai's starter code.  You shall 
      maintain the data structure used to store the anagrams,
      solutions, and hints.
    - Your program shall work within the Chrome browser.

Specifications:
    - You shall produce a single HTML file with JavaScript.
	- Your JavaScript will utilize addEventListener() and
	  removeEventListener() to manage where the user clicks
	  the mouse.  Elements should not be click-able when they
	  should not be used.
	- anagrams are only 3 characters long
	- there is a single hint for each anagram
	- there are only 2 anagrams for each scramble.  Note there
	  will most likely be other anagrams.  Your program shall
	  only accept the anagrams given.

Logic:
	- Present an HTML document with appropriate elements (and ids)
	  that can be modified/updated via JavaScript.
	- Display the available scrambles to solve to the user on the
	  left side.
	  - Update the 'info' element to ask the user to choose a 
	    scramble to solve.
      - Make the scrambles "click-able".
    - Once a scramble is selected, turn off scrambles from future 
	  clicks.
	- Enumerate the scramble letters at the top on the right-hand 
	  side.
	- Allow the user to click one of the two anagrams to solve 
      ('active1' or 'active2' elements);
	- Now enable the scramble letters.  As the user clicks each one,
	  update the appropriate 'gram1' or 'gram2' element.  If the 
	  user selects "DEL" then remove the last letter added to the 
	  anagram.  
    - If the user clicks on 'hint1' or 'hint2', display the hint for
	  that anagram.  Only the activated anagram's hint should be 
	  click-able.
	- Update the 'info' element with directions to the user at each
	  step.
	- Add a "Solved" element or button (your choice) for the user
	  to click once they've filled in the two anagrams.  If they 
	  click the Solved button/element, check the user's anagrams 
	  against the stored values and denote correctness or 
	  incorrectness appropriately.
	- Once solved, allow the user to select from the remaining 
      unsolved scrambles to solve.


Hints:
    - use console.log() to help debug your code.
	- I strongly recommend use of git repository!
	- You can use/declare global variables to keep state, make 
	  sure to use correct scope.
	- Start with the source code in
	  Canvas->Files-Assignments->Project2->P2_starter.html
	- Code each step of the game and test.  As each is working
	  correctly, add the next step, repeat.

Teams:
    - You have the option of working in teams of 2.  Each team 
	  member must contribute equally to the project.
